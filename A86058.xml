            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Alſo hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and coldneſſe are two contraties; and therefore they may not come nigh together without a mean, for the moiſtneſs on the one ſide bindeth them together, and drineſs on the other. Moiſtneſs is cauſe of every thick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp; of every ſwéet taſt: And there again, drineſs is cauſe of every thin ſubſtance, and of every ſower ſtinking ſaſte: and alſo hotneſs is cauſe of every red colour, and large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy: there again, coloneſs is cauſe of every white colour, and little quantity. Theſe four prime Qualities in their combination, make the four Elements. Aire, minſt and hot, the Fire hot and dry, the Earth dry and cold, the Water cold and moiſt. The Aire and Earth are two contraries, and therefore they may not come nigh together; but as fire binds them on the

Alſo Fire and water are two contraries, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not come nigh together; but as the air betwéen them binds on the one ſide, and the earth on the other ſide. The fire is ſharp, ſubtil and moveable. The Aire is ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, moveable, corpulent, and dull. The Earth is corpulent and thick. The water is move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, corpulent and dull. The Earth is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent, dull and unmodable: In the heart of the earth is the Center of the world; that is to ſay, the midſt point, and in every Center is Hell.

                     <p>THere be in the year four quarters, the which are named thus, <hi>Ver, Hyems, Aeſtas</hi> and <hi>Autumnus;</hi> Theſe are the four ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſous in the year. Prime time is the Spring of the year, containing <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> In theſe three Months every green thing growing beginneth to bud and flouriſh.</p>
                     <p>Then cometh Summer, as <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and in theſe three months every hearb, grain, and tree is in his moſt ſtrength and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154163:40"/>beauty, and then the <hi>Sun</hi> is at the higheſt. Next cometh Autumn, as <hi>Auguſt, September,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> wherein all Fruits wax ripe, and are gathered and houſed.</p>
                     <p>Then cometh <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> and theſe three Months be in the Winter; that time the <hi>Sun</hi> is at the loweſt, and is of little profit. We <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> ſay, That the Age of man is threeſcore and twelve years, and that we liken but one whole year; for evermore we take ſix years for every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as <hi>January</hi> or <hi>February,</hi> and ſo forth: for as the year changeth by the twelve mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, into twelve divers manners, ſo doth man change himſelf twelve times in his life, by twelve ages, and every ſix times ſix ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thirty ſix, and then man is at the beſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the higheſt; and twelve times ſix maketh threeſcore and twelve, and that is the age of man. Thus you may count and reckon for every Month ſix years, or elſe it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the four quarters and ſeaſons of the year, ſo man is divided into four parts, as to youth, ſtrength, wiſoom, and age.

                     <p>Then cometh <hi>February,</hi> and then the dayes lengthen, and the <hi>Sun</hi> is more hotter; then the fields begin to wax gréen. So the other ſix years till he come to twelve, the Child beginneth to grow bigger, and is apt to learn ſuch things as is taught him.</p>
                     <p>Then cometh the month of <hi>March,</hi> in which the Labourer ſoweth the Earth, and planteth trees, and edificeth houſes. The child in theſe ſir years waxeth big, to learn doctrine and ſcience, and to be fair and pleaſant, and loving; for then he is eigteen years of age.</p>

                     <p>Then cometh the young man to gather the ſweet flowers of hardineſs; but then beware that cold winds and ſtorms of Vices beat
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154163:41"/>not down the flowers of good manners, that ſhould bring a man to honour, for then he is twenty four years of age.</p>
                     <p>Then cometh <hi>May,</hi> that is both fair and pleaſant; for then Birds ſing in Woods and Forreſts night and day, the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhineth hot; then man is moſt luſty, mighty, and of proper ſtrength, and ſéeketh playes, ſport, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-paſtimes, for then he is full thirty years of age.</p>

                     <p>Then cometh <hi>July,</hi> that fruits be ſet on ſuning, and our Corn a bardning; but then the <hi>Sun</hi> beginneth a little to deſcend downward.

                     <p>Then cometh <hi>September,</hi> that winds be made, and the fruits of the trees be gathered: and there withal he doth freſhly begin to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his houſe, and make proviſion of needful things, for to live with in winter, which draweth very near: and then man is in his moſt ſtedfaſt and covetous eſtate, proſperous in wiſoome, purpoſing to gather and keep as much as ſhall be ſufficient for him in his age, when he may gather no more: and then he is fifty four years of age.</p>
                     <p>Then cometh <hi>October,</hi> when all is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both Corn and other manner of fruits, alſo the Labourers Plow, and ſow new ſeeds in the Earth for the year to come. And then he that nought ſoweth, nought gathereth: and then in theſe ſix years a man ſhall take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto God for to do penance and good works, and then the benefits the year after his death, he may gather and have ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and then man is fully the term of three. ſeere years.</p>
                     <p>Then cometh <hi>November</hi> that the dayes be very ſhort, and the <hi>Sun</hi> in a manner giveth but little heat, and the trées loſe their leaves, the

                        <p>THeſe four Tables are all to be uſed the ſame way, their difference being only in the Rate of the profit; which it is fit ſhould be more in houſes than in lands; becauſe hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſubject to be void of Tenants, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other caſualties of fire and ruine, which lands are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. And therefore I have (as briefly as I can) hinted in the Tables, which Table is fitteſt for any kind of purchaſe: not that any one is bound to make his bargain juſt according to theſe Rates; but hereby any one may judge of his Purchaſe, and know what profit he makes of his money.</p>
                        <p>The Tables of themſelves are ſo plain, that they need no explaining; I having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in altogether applyed my ſelf to the uſual way of reckoning theſe bargains to he worth ſo many years purchaſe. Onely the year for the more exactneſſe is divided into twelve months, and not into four quarters.</p>
                     </div>

                        <head>This example will make all plain.</head>
                        <p>It is deſired to know what the Leaſe of an Houſe for one and twenty years, is worth in ready money? To find out this, look in the laſt Table which is calculated after the rate of ten per Cent. and is fitteſt for ſuch kind of bargains; and in this Table at <hi>21</hi> years, you ſhall finde the value of the Leaſe to be worth <hi>8</hi> years and <hi>8</hi> months purchaſe. So that let the yearly rent or value of the houſe be what it will, the ſaid Leaſe of <hi>21</hi> years, is worth eight whole years rent, and almoſt three quarters of the ſaid yearly rent; which you may eaſily reckon up, and ſo know the true value of the purchaſe. And at this price you ſhall have <hi>10 per Cent.</hi> profit for your money.</p>
                        <p>I kave made theſe Tables to ſhew the worth of long Leaſes alſo, becauſe moſt men value a long Leaſe too much, in reſpect of the value they ſet upon a ſhort leaſe. Reekoning a leaſe of <hi>21</hi> years to be worth but <hi>7</hi> years, and yet thinking a Leaſe of <hi>60</hi> years to be worth <hi>12</hi> or <hi>13</hi> years purchaſe; Whereas you may ſée by this Table, that though the leaſe of <hi>21</hi> years be worth <hi>8</hi> years and <hi>8</hi> months purchaſe; yet the leaſe of <hi>60</hi> years
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154163:86"/>is not worth full <hi>10</hi> years purchaſe: may the leaſe of an hundred years, or the Fée-ſimple cannot be worth above <hi>10</hi> years purchaſe, allowing the ſaid rate of <hi>10 per cent</hi> for the money.</p>
                        <p>Many other queſtions of Purchaſes and Reverſions might be added; as you may ſée at large in my <hi>Purchaſers pattern,</hi> printed for <hi>Mr. Pierrepont,</hi> at the Sun in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church yard.</p>

                        <p>This to ſome may ſeem inpoſſible, but to the Arithmetitian very eaſie; for whereas the eldeſt had 3 penyworths and one apple over, the ſecond 2 penyworths and 2 apples
